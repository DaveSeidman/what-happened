# What Happened In Vegas

The idea behind this site is to promote conversation around the tragic shooting
that took place on October 1st, 2017 involving a lone shooter that killed 58
concert-goers and spark users into action on the issue of gun control in America.

The mechanic of the site is to allow users to tweet with the hashtag
/#WhatHappenedInVegas already attached, then hopefully go to one of the sites
we link to and donate their money, time, phonecalls, etc. to moving us towards a
safer society via better gun control.
